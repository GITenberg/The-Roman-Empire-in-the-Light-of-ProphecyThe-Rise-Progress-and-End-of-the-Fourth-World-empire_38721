<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following pages are the outcome of
several conversations with inquirers
shortly after the outbreak of the great war,
in 1914, and of requests for notes of the views
expressed. The subject of these conversations
had occupied the earnest if intermittent
attention of the writer for over twenty years.
The notes were expanded into a series of
articles which appeared in <i>The Witness</i>
during 1915. These have been revised and
somewhat extended for the present volume,
especially the last chapter, much of which was
previously precluded by limitations of space.</p>

<p>In regard to past history, the outlines of
events connected with the Roman and Turkish
Empires are given with the hope that the
records will prove helpful to those who read
the history of Nations in the light of Scripture.</p>

<p>In regard to the future, while there are
many events which the Word of God has foretold
with absolute clearness, and upon these
we may speak unreservedly, yet there are
many circumstances concerning which definite
prediction has been designedly withheld,
and upon which prophecy is therefore
obscure. In such matters an effort has been
made to avoid dogmatism. Prophecy was
not given in order for us to prophesy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the prophetic Scriptures
are not to be neglected. Difficulty in understanding
them is no reason for disregarding
them. They are part of that Word, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of which is declared to be "profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness" (2 Tim. 3. 16).
They therefore demand prayerful and patient
meditation.</p>

<p>For a speaker to refer to the study of the
prophecies in a way which tends to minimise
their importance in the minds of his hearers
is to dishonour both the sacred Word and Him
who inspired it. It is significant that the
book of the Revelation opens with a promise
of blessing to him who reads (the reference is
especially to public reading) and to those who
"hear the words of the prophecy, and keep
the things which are written therein" (chap.
1. 3), and at the close repeats the blessing for
him who keeps its words (chap. 22. 7).</p>

<p>The quotations in the present volume are
from the Revised Version, the comparatively
greater accuracy of its translations being
important for a correct understanding of
many of the passages considered.</p>

<p>While the book is published at the request
of several friends, the author fulfils such
request with the earnest desire that in matters
of doctrine that only may be accepted which
can be confirmed from the Word of God
itself, and that the Lord may graciously own
what is in accordance with His mind for the
glory of His Name and the profit of the
reader.</p>

Light of Prophecy.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></h2>

<h3>THE TIMES OF THE GENTILES.</h3>


<p>The overthrow of the kingdom of Judah
recorded in 2 Kings 24 and 25, and in
the opening words of the book of Daniel,
was a remarkable crisis in the history of
the world. In judgment upon the people
of God for their long-continued iniquity,
sovereignty was removed from their hands,
king and people were led into captivity,
and Jerusalem was, in fulfilment of
Jeremiah's words, given into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (Jer.
21. 10). The government of their land
was thus committed to the Gentiles, and
with the Gentiles it has remained from that
day till now. These events took place in
606 and 587 <small>B.C.</small></p>


<h4>The Times of the Gentiles.</h4>

<p>But Gentile control is not to continue
indefinitely. This, which is plain from
many Scriptures, was intimated by Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to His disciples when He said of Jerusalem
that the city would "be trodden down of
the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles
be fulfilled" (Luke 21. 24). The phrase,
"the times of the Gentiles," calls for consideration,
and especially as it has to do
with Nebuchadnezzar's conquest just
mentioned.</p>

<p>There are two words translated "times"
in the New Testament; one is <i>chronoi</i>,
which is invariably rendered "times;" the
other is <i>kairoi</i>, which, when the two are
found together, is rendered "seasons."
Thus Paul, in writing to the Thessalonian
Church, says, "But concerning the times
and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need
that aught be written unto you" (1
Thess. 5. 1, <small>R.V.</small>; cp. Acts 1.7). We may
distinguish "seasons" from "times" in
the following way: "times" denotes mere
duration, lengths of time; "seasons" implies
that these lengths of time have certain
events or circumstances associated with
them by which they are characterised.
Thus the words almost exactly correspond
to the terms "periods" and "epochs."
Now the word <i>kairoi</i>, "seasons," is used
in the phrase translated "the times of the
Gentiles," which might accordingly be
rendered "the seasons of the Gentiles."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
We look, then, for some special characteristic
of the period or periods thus designated.
We have observed that Nebuchadnezzar's
overthrow of the kingdom of Judah involved
the transference of its sovereignty
from Jew to Gentile from that event onward.
"The times of the Gentiles," accordingly,
is that period, or succession of
periods, during which dominion over the
Jews and their land is committed to
Gentile Powers.</p>


<h4>Nebuchadnezzar's Dream.</h4>

<p>Special significance attaches to the fact
that no sooner had the times of the Gentiles
begun than God made known the future
course of their authority over His people,
and the character and doom of that authority,
and made it known to the first
Gentile conqueror himself. It was in the
second year of his reign that Nebuchadnezzar
saw in a dream the great image by
means of which the purposes of God were
to be communicated to him. The description
of this, given by Daniel to the troubled
monarch, is as follows: "Thou, O king,
sawest, and behold a great image. This
image, which was mighty, and whose
brightness was excellent, stood before thee;
and the aspect thereof was terrible. As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
this image, his head was of fine gold, his
breast and his arms of silver, his belly
and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron,
his feet part of iron, and part of clay. Thou
sawest till that a stone was cut out without
hands, which smote the image upon his
feet that were of iron and clay, and brake
them in pieces. Then was the iron, the
clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
broken in pieces together, and became like
the chaff of the summer threshing-floors:
and the wind carried them away, that no
place was found for them: and the stone
that smote the image became a great
mountain, and filled the whole earth"
(Dan. 2. 31-35).</p>

<p>Interpreting this vision, the prophet
identified Nebuchadnezzar, the Chaldean
monarch, with the head of gold, and foretold
that his kingdom, or empire, would
be followed in succession by three others,
corresponding respectively to the different
parts of the remainder of the image and to
the nature of the metals composing them.
Of the four kingdoms the last is to engage
our chief attention in these papers. Passing
from the first, the <b>Chaldean</b>, as
specified in Daniel's words to the king,
"Thou art this head of gold" (v. 38), we
are shown that the second kingdom was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that of the <b>Medes and Persians</b> by the
prophet's record of the doom of Nebuchadnezzar's
successor, Belshazzar: "In that
night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was
slain. And Darius the Mede received the
kingdom" (Dan. 5. 30, 31; cp. v. 28).
That the third kingdom was the <b>Grecian</b>
we find in the interpretation of part of a
vision recorded in the eighth chapter:
"The ram which thou sawest that had the
two horns, they are the kings of Media
and Persia. And the rough he-goat [who
was seen to destroy the ram, v. 8] is the
king of Greece" (vv. 20, 21; cp. chap.
10. 20).</p>


<h4>The Fourth Kingdom.</h4>

<p>The name of the fourth kingdom is not
mentioned in the Old Testament, but the
prediction given in the ninth chapter of
Daniel's prophecies sufficiently identifies
it. Messiah, it was said, would be cut off,
and the people of a coming prince would
destroy the city and the sanctuary. Now
we know that the perpetrators of this were
the Romans. We know, too, that by
them the Grecian empire was conquered.
The world-wide rule of the first <b>Roman</b>
Emperor is indicated in the words of
Luke's introduction to his record of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
birth of Christ: "Now it came to pass in
those days, there went out a decree from
Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should
be enrolled" (Luke 2. 1).</p>

<p>It is important to note that this fourth
kingdom will, in its final condition, be in
world-wide authority at the close of the
times of the Gentiles, that is, that the
Roman power, though in a divided state,
will not be finally destroyed until it meets
its doom at the hands of the Son of God.
This fact, which will receive fuller treatment
later, and is borne out by several
Scriptures, is plainly indicated in the
passage which describes the last state of
the fourth kingdom and its destruction.
Immediately after showing that it would be
a divided kingdom, and describing the
nature of that division (vv. 41-43), the
prophet says: "And in the days of those
kings shall the God of Heaven set up a
kingdom, which shall never be destroyed,
nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to
another people; but it shall break in pieces
and consume all these kingdoms, and it
shall stand for ever" (v. 44). Now this
indestructible kingdom cannot be other
than that of Christ, and by His kingdom
the fourth is to be broken in pieces and consumed,
thus involving the overthrow of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
forms of Gentile authority. Obviously
no form of world government will exist
between that of the fourth kingdom, in
its condition described in verses 42, 43,
and the kingdom of Christ which destroys it.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h2>

<h3>THE ROMAN DOMINION.</h3>


<p>An understanding of the Scriptures does
not depend upon access to other books,
or reference to historical records outside
the limits of the Bible. The Word of
God is its own interpreter, and all that is
needed for our establishment in the faith
is contained in its pages. On the other
hand, the Bible throws light upon history
not recorded therein, and it is with that
in view that we give certain historical
outlines in dealing with our subject.</p>

<p>The first part of the prophet's description
of the fourth kingdom is as follows:
"The fourth kingdom shall be strong as
iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces
and subdueth all things: and as iron that
crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces
and crush" (v. 40). A similar description
is given in his account of a subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
vision, in which he saw four great beasts
coming up from the sea. In this vision
the Roman kingdom again was undoubtedly
symbolised by the fourth beast. This
beast he describes as "terrible and powerful,
and strong exceedingly; and it had great
iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces,
and stamped the residue with his feet"
(7. 7). So, again, in the words of the interpretation:
"The fourth beast shall be a
fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be
diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall
devour the whole earth, and shall tread it
down, and break it in pieces" (v. 23).
Now all this exactly depicts the Roman
power in its subjugation and control of
the nations which eventually composed
its empire. In the light, then, of these
prophecies we give a brief sketch of its
rise and conquests.</p>


<h4>The Rise and Progress of the Roman
Empire.</h4>

<p>The Romans, who early in the third
century <small>B.C.</small> had become masters of all
Italy, save in the extreme north, were
drawn into a course of conquest beyond
the limits of their own country by the
rivalry of the rapidly advancing power of
Carthage in North Africa. Carthage, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
city founded some centuries earlier by
Ph&oelig;nician colonists from Tyre and Sidon,
had at length become the capital of a great
North African empire, stretching from
Tripoli to the Atlantic Ocean, and embracing
settlements elsewhere in countries
and islands of the Mediterranean. These
settlements included the greater part of
Sicily, and that island, situated between
the rival nations, became the first bone of
contention between them. The precise
cause of the struggle must not occupy us
here, but the circumstances which decided
the Roman Government, in 264 <small>B.C.</small>, upon
an invasion of Sicily were of the deepest
significance in the history of the world.
By the year 242 Sicily was subdued. In
the following year the island was ceded by
Carthage, and the extension of Roman
dominion beyond Italy was begun. The
war continued intermittently, with many
vicissitudes, for a century, but eventually
the Carthagians were overwhelmingly defeated
by land and sea. "Think you that
Carthage or that Rome will be content,
after the victory, with its own country and
Sicily?" said a Greek orator, while the
issues of the struggle in its earliest stage
were yet in the balance. Rome's vast
ambition, and her abundant means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
gratifying it, justified the orator's fears.
The islands of Sardinia and Corsica were
shortly afterwards seized.</p>

<p>Defeated in Sicily, Carthage extended
her dominions in Spain and made that
country a base for marching through Gaul
to attack the Romans from the north.
Though their renowned leader Hannibal
met with success, their effort was doomed
to failure. Meanwhile Roman armies had
pushed into Spain. After a fierce struggle
of thirteen years the Carthagians were completely
overcome there, and Spain soon
became a Roman province. By the decisive
battle of Zama, in North Africa, in 202,
Carthage and its territories became tributary,
and thus all the western Mediterranean
passed under the supremacy of
Rome. Eventually in 146, as a result of
a final war, Carthage was razed to the
ground, and its North African kingdom
was constituted a Roman province under
the name of Africa. War with the Celts
in North Italy, commencing the next year,
resulted in the extension of the boundary to
the Alps, and countries beyond began to
feel the terror of the Roman name.</p>


<h4>Eastward Extension.</h4>

<p>The second century <small>B.C.</small> witnessed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
spread of the iron rule eastward. The
Grecian Empire of Alexander the Great,
the third mentioned in Daniel's interpretation,
had embraced all the countries
surrounding the eastern half of the Mediterranean
and had stretched far beyond
the Euphrates. The disintegration of
Alexander's empire after his death
prepared the way for the Romans. Macedonia,
the former seat of that empire, was
their first great objective. A pretext for
war was soon forthcoming, and war was
actually declared in 200 <small>B.C.</small> A series
of struggles ensued, and Macedonia was
not finally subdued for over thirty years.
Meanwhile matters had developed in
Greece and Asia Minor. In the latter
country Antiochus III., the Great, who had
also conquered Syria and Palestine, was
seeking to extend his dominions. Cities and
states of Asia Minor, however, groaning
under the tyranny of Antiochus, appealed to
Rome for aid. The Romans declared war
against him in 192 <small>B.C.</small> The first conflict
occurred in Greece, which was largely under
his influence. An early victory secured the
submission of the Greek states. Antiochus
retreated into Asia Minor, and was finally
crushed at Magnesia in 190. The whole
of Asia Minor was then surrendered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Rome. Actual possession was postponed
and local government was largely granted
both there and in Greece. But that
policy proved impracticable, and the
force of circumstances compelled a forward
movement to universal empire. There
was no such thing as the balance of power
in the ancient world. Once a country
became predominant there was nothing
for it but the subjugation of its neighbours.
The extension of Rome's dominions eastward
was a fulfilment of a destiny beyond
its own control. The reverent student of
Scripture sees in the course of these events
the unfolding of God's plans and the
fulfilment of His Word.</p>

<p>The final campaign against the Macedonians
was opened in 169 <small>B.C.</small>, and in the
next year they were overwhelmed at the
decisive battle of Pydna. Macedonia and
the adjacent state of Illyria became tributary,
and eventually were reduced to Roman
provinces.</p>

<p>The Romans then felt the necessity
of definitely annexing Greece. Seventy
towns in that country were plundered
and 150,000 inhabitants were sold into
slavery. Antiochus IV., Epiphanes, was
now king of Syria and Palestine, and
had possessed himself of almost the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
whole of Egypt. Such was the effect of
the battle of Pydna, however, that he
was at once compelled to hand over
Egypt to the conquerors, and that country
became a Roman protectorate. Syria
passed under Roman control at the death
of Antiochus Epiphanes, in 164, and by
the end of a few decades all the states of
Asia Minor had been incorporated.</p>

<p>Thus by the middle of this century
the Republic of Rome had gained
ascendancy east and west. Its senate was
recognised by the civilised world as "the
supreme tribunal for kings and nations."
Early in the next century Dalmatia
and Thrace were subdued, and the latter
was incorporated in the province of Macedonia.
Wars with Mithradates, King of
Pontus, Cappadocia and Armenia, resulted
in the conquest of all his territories,
and provinces were formed out of the states
from thence westward to the Ægean sea.</p>


<h4>Palestine Annexed.</h4>

<p>This century saw the actual interference
of Rome in the affairs of Judæa. Syria
had been made a province in 65 <small>B.C.</small> by
the Roman General Pompey, and from
thence he intervened in a strife which had
for some time been raging amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
leaders of the Jews. In 63 he marched an
army into Judæa and took Jerusalem. At
the final assault upon the Temple 12,000
Jews perished. Judæa thus passed under
the iron heel.</p>

<p>As a result of the wars of Cæsar in north-western
Europe, in 58-51 <small>B.C.</small>, what are
now Switzerland, France, and Belgium
were subdued and Britain was invaded.
By Cæsar also Roman authority in Africa
was consolidated across the entire length
of the north of the continent. The conquests
of Rome as a Republic were
complete. The Mediterranean had become
a "Roman lake."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus023.jpg" width="500" height="340" alt="THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN APOSTOLIC TIMES." title="THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN APOSTOLIC TIMES." />
</div>


<h4>The Empire Completed.</h4>

<p>In 27 <small>B.C.</small> the purely Republican form
of constitution was abolished, and the
government of the Roman world was concentrated
in the hands of an Emperor, the
Cæsar Augustus of Luke 2.1. In his reign
were fulfilled the prophecies foretelling the
Birth of Christ. When the Prince of Peace
was born in Bethlehem the din of strife
was hushed throughout the empire, and
Rome, under the restraining hand of God,
ceased for a time its warring. By Augustus
the northern territories of the empire were
extended to practically the entire length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the Danube. The greater part of Britain
became a province under Claudius. A
later Emperor, Trajan, added, at the beginning
of the second century <small>A.D.</small>, the
province of Dacia, covering what are
now Transylvania and most of Roumania.
Under Marcus Aurelius (161-180)
a large part of Mesopotamia was finally
annexed.</p>

<p>This completes the actual conquests of
the Romans. We will now note certain
characteristics of their method of subjugation,
viewed in the light of Daniel's
prophecy concerning the fourth kingdom,
that, like iron, it would "break in pieces
and crush."</p>


<h4>The Crushing of the Nations.</h4>

<p>The crushing process was evidenced in
many ways, and especially by the establishment
of a general system of slavery,
which almost everywhere supplanted free
labour. Slave-hunting and slave-dealing
became a profession. To such an extent
were they carried on at one period that certain
provinces were well nigh depopulated.
We are told that at the great slave-market
in the island of Delos, off
Greece, as many as ten thousand slaves
were disembarked in the morning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
bought up before the evening of the same
day. Chained gangs worked under overseers
and were confined in prison at night.
To take an instance of the extreme rigour
of the laws regulating the traffic, it is recorded
by the historian Tacitus, that once,
when the Prefect of Rome had been killed
by one of his slaves, of whom he owned a
vast number, the whole of his slaves, many
of them women and children, were executed
together, in accordance with an ancient
law. That event took place about the
time, apparently, at which the Apostle
Paul arrived at Rome.</p>

<p>But not only were the nations ground
down by slavery, the pages of Roman
history abound in records of wholesale
massacre and butchery. We may note,
for instance, Luke's statement of Pilate's
slaughter of Galilæans while they were
sacrificing (Luke 13. 1). Records abound,
too, of grossly burdensome taxation and
financial exactions, in which the Romans
outdid all tyrants that had preceded them.
Usury flourished in the last century
as it had never done before. Four per cent.
per month was an ordinary exaction
for a loan to a community. On one
occasion a Roman banker, who had a claim
on the municipality of Salamis, in Cyprus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
kept its council blockaded until five of its
members died of hunger.</p>

<p>By these methods the provinces of the
empire were at one period reduced to a
condition of unsurpassed misery. Nothing
could more vividly describe the course of
such a kingdom and the control exercised
by it than the words of Daniel quoted above.</p>


<h4>The Twofold Division.</h4>

<p>This fourth kingdom was destined to be
divided; and in two respects, territorial
and constitutional. The territorial division
was indicated by the symbolism of the legs
and feet of the image of Nebuchadnezzar's
vision; the constitutional division was
declared in Daniel's interpretation concerning
the iron and clay (v. 40). The
former of these divisions claims our consideration
first. Territorially the kingdom
would be first divided into two parts
corresponding with the legs of the image.
This actually took place in the fourth
century of the present era.</p>

<p>The Roman Empire had continued in a
more or less united condition for over three
centuries after the accession of its first
Emperor, Augustus, in 27 <small>B.C.</small>, though
various signs of a coming division manifested
themselves. It was not unusual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for instance, for an emperor to appoint an
associate with himself in the imperial
rank, and on one occasion Maximian, who
thus became associated with Diocletian
in <small>A.D.</small> 288, actually established his seat
of government at Nicomedia, in Asia Minor.
Constantine (323-337) united the empire
under his sole rule, but paved the way for
the final separation of east from west by
founding, in 328, the city of Constantinople
as a second Rome, after his own name,
and establishing it as an eastern centre of
government with its own legislative institutions.
This arrangement was favoured
by several conditions, national and otherwise,
which characterised the countries of
the eastern half as distinct from those of
the western.</p>

<p>At the death of Constantine, in 337,
his dominions were divided among his
three sons, a division, however, which
lasted but a brief time. The empire was
in 353 again united under Constantius, the
survivor of the three. The long impending
division into two parts took place under
Valentinian I., in the year of his accession,
364. Yielding to the wish of his soldiers
that he should associate a colleague with
himself, he placed his brother Valens in
power in the east, with headquarters at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Constantinople, he himself retaining control
over the west.</p>


<h4>The Tenfold Division.</h4>

<p>Prophetic Scriptures show that the
Roman Empire would be further divided.
Now while the ten toes of the image in
Nebuchadnezzar's dream have not improperly
been regarded as indicative of a
tenfold division, the fact that the image
had ten toes would be insufficient of itself
to signify this, for the toes are naturally
essential to a complete human figure.
Moreover, the hands and their fingers,
equally essential parts, have no territorial
significance attached to them. The conclusion
regarding the toes is, however,
justified when we find the tenfold division
abundantly confirmed by other Scriptures.</p>

<p>Thus the fourth beast in the vision in
chapter 7, which, as we have seen, likewise
symbolised the Roman kingdom, is
described as having <i>ten horns</i> (v. 7). The
interpretation clearly tells us what these
are: "And as for the ten horns, out of the
kingdom (the fourth) shall <i>ten kings</i>
arise" (v. 24). The Apocalypse gives us
further information regarding this division,
unfolding with increasing clearness the
details connected with it. In one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
visions given to the apostle John, he sees
"a great red dragon, having seven heads
and <i>ten horns</i>" (Rev. 12. 3). The meaning
of the ten horns is not there explained.
We are told that the great dragon is "the
old serpent, he that is called the Devil and
Satan, the deceiver of the whole world"
(v. 9). Turning now to the next chapter,
we find another vision recorded, giving a
fresh view of the same subject. A beast
was seen "coming up out of the sea, having
<i>ten horns</i> and seven heads, and on his
horns ten diadems, and upon his heads
names of blasphemy" (chap. 13. 1).
Again an explanation of the ten horns is
withheld, but that they are identical with
those of the twelfth chapter is undeniable.
The Apostle receives, however, a further
vision, recorded in chapter 17: "I saw a
woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured
beast, full of names of blasphemy, having
seven heads and <i>ten horns</i>" (chap. 17. 3).
And now the symbolism of the horns is
explained: "the ten horns that thou
sawest are <i>ten kings</i>, which have received
no kingdom as yet; but they receive
authority as kings, with the beast, for one
hour. These have one mind, and they
give their power and authority unto the
beast" (vv. 12, 13).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>We are now concerned, of course,
solely with the tenfold division of the
empire; other details of the visions just
referred to remain for later consideration.
We cannot fail to see that what is symbolised
by the ten toes of the image, and
by the ten horns of the fourth beast as
revealed to Daniel, is identical with what
is symbolised by the ten horns of the
dragon and of the beast seen by John,
namely, the Roman kingdom in its ultimately
divided condition.</p>


<h4>A Comparison of the Visions.</h4>

<p>The following points are noteworthy
in comparing these visions relatively to the
tenfold division. First, there is a parallelism
in the order of the revelations
given to the two seers, Daniel and John.
A preliminary vision is given to each&mdash;more
than one in the case of John&mdash;in
which, in the matter of this territorial
partition, symbols occur without explanation.
Each then receives a further
vision, in the interpretation of which the
eventual division into ten kingdoms is
plainly disclosed. To Daniel it is said:
"As for the ten horns, out of the kingdom
shall ten kings arise;" and to John: "The
ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
which receive authority as kings with the
beast for one hour."</p>

<p>Second, the ten kingdoms are seen to be
contemporaneous, as is indicated by the
co-existence of the ten horns of the beast,
and further, by the fact that the ten kings
mutually agree to a certain line of policy
in handing over their authority to a supreme
potentate (Rev. 17. 12, 13).</p>

<p>Third, it is evident that the fourth
kingdom is the last of the Gentile world-powers,
and that it will exist in its tenfold
state at the end of the times of the
Gentiles. We observed this above in the
case of the image, from the fact that the
stone, symbolising the kingdom of Christ,
smote the image upon its toes. So now, in
the vision of the four beasts, it is the fourth
beast that is slain, his body destroyed, and
given to be burned (Dan. 7. 11). The
Personal Agent of this destruction is here
made known: "I saw in the night visions,
and, behold, there came with the clouds
of Heaven One like unto a son of man, and
He came even to the Ancient of Days, ...
and there was given Him dominion, and
glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples,
nations, and languages should serve Him:
His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
which shall not pass away, and His kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that which shall not be destroyed"
(vv. 13, 14). The finality of the fourth
kingdom is clearer still from the interpretation
given in the remainder of the
chapter. The final world-ruler is, of
course, prominent in this vision; in his
destruction is involved the destruction of
his kingdom; his power and aggression are
terminated when the Ancient of Days
comes (v. 22); then it is that "the judgment
shall sit, and they shall take away
his dominion, to consume and to destroy
it unto the end. And the kingdom and the
dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms
under the whole heaven, shall be
given to the people of the saints of the Most
High: His kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, and all dominions shall serve
and obey Him" (vv. 26, 27). Similarly,
again, in Revelation 13 and 17, in the
corresponding visions of the beast and its
ten horns, the ten kings and their federal
head, ruling at the time of the end, "shall
war against the Lamb, and the Lamb
shall overcome them, for He is Lord of
lords, and King of kings; and they <i>also
shall overcome</i> that are with Him, called
and chosen and faithful" (Rev. 17. 14).</p>

<p>The crushing of the image by the stone,
the slaying of the fourth beast before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Ancient of Days, and the conquest of the
ten kings and their chief by the Lamb, are
therefore different views of the same
event. The tenfold division of the fourth
kingdom is obviously still future, and
marks the condition of the world-government
at the close of the times of the
Gentiles, and immediately prior to the
kingdom of Christ.</p>


<h4>The Testimony of Early Christian
Writers.</h4>

<p>That the Roman Empire would in its
final form be divided into ten kingdoms
was held by Christian writers of the
earliest post-apostolic times. Their
opinions are here given, not as forming any
basis of exposition, but as expressions
of early Christian conception of the
Scriptures under consideration.</p>

<p>What is known as "<i>The Epistle of
Barnabas</i>," probably written early in
the second century <small>A.D.</small>, quotes from
Daniel concerning the ten kingdoms to
show that they would exist at the consummation
of the present age. <i>Irenæus</i>
(circa <small>A.D.</small> 120-202), a disciple of Polycarp,
who had been a companion of the
apostle John, observes that "the ten toes
are ten kings, among whom the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
will be divided." <i>Tertullian</i>, a contemporary
of Irenæus, remarks that "the
disintegration and dispersion of the Roman
State among the ten kings will produce
Antichrist, and then shall be revealed
that Wicked One, whom the Lord Jesus
shall slay with the breath of His mouth
and destroy by the brightness of His
manifestation." <i>Hippolytus</i>, who was a
follower of Irenæus, and flourished in the
first half of the third century, makes
similar reference to the ultimate division.
<i>Lactantius</i>, of the latter half of the third
and the early part of the fourth centuries,
writes as follows: "The Empire will be
sub-divided, and the powers of government,
after being frittered away and
shared among many, will be undermined.
Civil discords will then ensue, nor will
there be respite from destructive wars,
until ten kings arise at once, who will
divide the world among themselves to
consume rather than to govern it." <i>Cyril</i>
(circa 315-386), who became bishop of
Jerusalem in 350, quoting from Daniel,
and speaking of the Empire and its future
division, implies that teaching on the
subject was customary in the churches.
<i>Jerome</i> (342-420) observes that "at the
end of the world, when the kingdom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Romans is to be destroyed, there will be
ten kings to divide the Roman world
among themselves." Similarly writes
<i>Theodoret</i> in the fifth century, and others
of that time make more or less direct
reference to the subject. While the views
of these writers differ considerably on
other points of detail, all are unanimous
as to the eventual division of the Empire
among ten contemporaneous potentates.</p>


<h4>Processes at Work Since the
Twofold Division.</h4>

<p>The mediæval and modern history of
the lands originally constituting the
Roman Empire is a history of the formation
of independent states in such a way
as to point to the eventual revival of the
Empire in the tenfold division we have
been considering. The process has been a
long and involved one, for the counsels
of God have had a far wider range than
the mere shaping of national destiny. It
has been the Divine pleasure, for instance,
that the Gospel should be spread among
all nations for the purpose of taking out
from among them a people for the Name
of Christ, and for the formation thereby
of His Church. In contradistinction to
this, and from the standpoint of the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
itself, which, though under God's control,
remains in alienation from Him, there
has been a gradual development of the
political, social, and religious principles
which are ultimately to permeate the
nations.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></h2>

<h3>THE OVERTHROW IN THE WEST:
GERMANIC INVASIONS.</h3>


<p>In the interpretation of his vision of the
beast, John is told of its rise, temporary
removal, and reappearance: "The beast
that thou sawest was, and is not; and is
about to come up out of the abyss, and to
go into perdition" (Rev. 17. 8). Here the
Roman world-power, the imperial dominion,
is in view. In verse 11 the final
king himself is similarly described. The
symbol of the beast is thus employed
to describe first the dominion and then
its imperial head. This symbolic association
of locality and ruler is found elsewhere
in Scripture, and is illustrated in this very
chapter. The seven heads of the beast, for
example, are interpreted in both ways:
"The seven heads are seven mountains, ...
and they are seven kings" (v. 9, <small>R.V.</small> )
The distinction between verses 8 and 11<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
may be observed in this way: in the first
part of the chapter, verses 1-8, the beast
is viewed as a whole, indicating world-wide
government; in verse 11 the scope of
the symbol is limited, the beast is a
person, and is identified with one of
the seven heads, or kings, he is "himself
also an eighth, and is of the seven." With
this individual we shall be occupied later.</p>

<p>A striking illustration of the symbolic
use of the word "beast" to denote both a
kingdom and the ruler over it is to be
found in Dan. 7, where the following
statements are made: "These great beasts,
which are four, are four kings" (v. 17),
and "The fourth beast shall be the fourth
kingdom" (v. 23).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">
<img src="images/illus039.jpg" width="446" height="500" alt="THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE UNDER GERMANIC TRIBES" title="THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE UNDER GERMANIC TRIBES" />
</div>

<p>The statement of verse 8 seems, then,
undoubtedly to refer to the Empire; it did
exist, it ceased to be, and it will reappear.
The assertion that it "is not" must not be
taken to mean that the beast had ceased to
exist in John's time. The present tense is
to be regarded as prophetic. The verb
"to be" often has the force of continuance
of existence. The whole statement
implies a past existence, a discontinuance
of that existence, a future reappearance.
In the vision recorded in the thirteenth
chapter, John saw one of the heads of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
beast "as though it had been smitten unto
death." If, as seems probable, this head is
imperialism, then the overthrow of imperial
Rome is likewise indicated in that
passage.</p>

<p>In the light, then, of the words: "The
beast that thou sawest was, and is not,"
we may now consider how the Roman
Empire was overthrown.</p>


<h4>Disintegration of the Western Half.</h4>

<p>We have seen that, at the accession of
the Emperor Valentinian I. in <small>A.D.</small> 364,
the Empire was divided into two parts.
The succeeding century witnessed the
disintegration of the western half. The
cause was primarily from within. Augustus,
the first Emperor, had instituted a policy
of settling colonies of "barbarians" from
northern Europe within the frontiers of the
Empire. Later Emperors adopted the
policy more generally. The significance
of this lies in the fact that by the barbarians
who had already been thus established
in the Empire, the attacks were
commenced which resulted in the dismemberment
of its western provinces.</p>


<h4>Alaric and the Goths.</h4>

<p>At the close of the fourth century hordes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of Gothic tribes from north-eastern and
eastern Germany set out, under Alaric
their chief, in quest of new lands. Settlements
of these very Goths had already
been established south of the Danube by
the Imperial Government as allies of the
Romans. After an excursion into Italy,
in which they were temporarily checked,
they poured, in 406, into defenceless Gaul.
From thence Alaric returned to invade
Italy, and three times in three years besieged
Rome (408-410), eventually sacking
the city. After his death, in 410, the
Goths retired from Italy, entered Gaul,
and permanently occupied the southern
part of that country and a large part of
Spain, where they were known as <b>Visigoths</b>
(<i>i.e.</i>, Western Goths).</p>

<p>Other Germanic tribes also streamed
into Gaul. Of these, the <b>Franks</b> (whence
the name France) issued from districts
around the middle and lower Rhine and
occupied northern Gaul; the <b>Suevi</b>, from
north and north-west Germany, passed
through into Spain; the <b>Alani</b>, formerly
from eastern Europe, settled in west
France and Spain; the <b>Burgundians</b>,
from eastern Germany, seized that part of
Gaul which eventually was named after
them, Burgundy. The <b>Vandals</b>, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
northern and central Germany, after being
defeated by the Franks, crossed into
Spain under their leader Genseric, and
from thence established themselves in
the province of Africa, in 429. This
occupation of Gaul and Spain was soon
perforce recognised by the Emperor at
Rome. At the death of the Emperor
Honorius, in 423, Rome exercised little
more than a nominal authority over the
greater part of the west.</p>

<p>From Britain the Roman troops were
withdrawn by Honorius, in 409, though
the final abandonment of the island province
did not take place till 436. Teutonic
tribes from North Europe were soon engaged
in invading this part of the Empire.
The <b>Jutes</b>, from Jutland, landed in 449,
the <b>Saxons</b> in 477, and about the same
time the <b>Angles</b>.</p>


<h4>Attila and the Huns.</h4>

<p>Toward the close of the reign of Valentinian
III. (433-455), Gaul and Italy were
invaded by the <b>Huns</b> under Attila. The
Huns originally inhabited a large part of
central and northern Asia. In the latter
part of the fourth century they moved
west into Scythia and Germany, driving
the Goths before them. Attila's dominions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
thereafter extended over a vast area of
eastern, central, and northern Europe,
and he was regarded as of equal standing
with the Emperors at Constantinople and
Rome. After a gigantic but futile incursion
into Gaul, in 451, the Huns rushed
into Italy, ravaging its northern plains.
An embassy from Rome and an immense
ransom saved the situation. Attila died
in 453, and Italy was evacuated. The
Huns eventually settled in south-eastern
Europe, and their dominion dwindled
away. A trace of their name may be
found in the word Hungary.</p>


<h4>Genseric and the Vandals.</h4>

<p>In North Africa Genseric the Vandal
established a powerful dominion, and set
about preparing an invasion of Italy by
sea. In 455 (the last year of the reign of
Valentinian III.) his army of Vandals and
Moors attacked Rome, which was again
given over to pillage. Its wealth and
treasures were transported to Carthage,
and with them the vessels of the temple
at Jerusalem; these had been brought to
Rome in <small>A.D.</small> 70 by Titus, the conqueror
of Jerusalem. For twenty years after
Genseric's achievement Roman Emperors
existed in little else than name, the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
power being in the hands of a barbarian
officer. In 476 the last Emperor was deposed
by Odoacer, the king of the Heruli,
a tribe which, issuing from the shores of
the Baltic, made successful inroads into
Italy and occupied much of the country.
Odoacer was, at the request of the Roman
Senate, given the reins of government by
the eastern Emperor Zeno, and news was
despatched to the court at Constantinople
that no longer was there an Emperor of the
west. Subsequently, in 493, Odoacer was
slain by Theodoric, the king of the <b>Ostrogoths</b>,
who then became predominant in
the Italian peninsula. The Ostrogoths
(<i>i.e.</i>, Eastern Goths) had broken off from
the main body of their nation, and after
settling south of the Danube moved into
the province of Dalmatia.</p>


<h4>Northern Limits of the Empire.</h4>

<p>Other Germanic tribes, in addition to
those named above, firmly established
themselves within the northern limits of
the Empire. Of these, two are worthy of
mention, the <b>Alemanni</b>, who occupied
most of what is now Switzerland and districts
northward, and the <b>Lombards</b>, who
settled in north Italy and the territory
north-east of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Ten Kingdoms not Formed by the
Germanic Invasions.</h4>

<p>There have been various attempts to
identify with the ten prophetic kingdoms
the states formed from the western half of
the Roman Empire by the Germanic tribes
from the north. Such attempts fail from
the standpoints both of history and of
prophecy. To group the tribes so as to
make ten kingdoms out of them is, of
course, possible in several ways, for there
were at least eighteen such tribes.
Accordingly lists put forward differ
considerably. But such grouping is
manifestly arbitrary. Again, since these
invading nations occupied only the western
half of the Empire, the above allocation
of the ten kingdoms necessarily leaves the
eastern half out of consideration, and
therefore excludes the land of Palestine
from this stage of the prophetic forecast.</p>

<p>Now the prophecies concerning the times
of the Gentiles are invariably focussed upon
the Jews and their land. The dealings of
God with the Jews form the pivot of His
dealings with other nations. Thus no
scheme of prophetic exposition relative
to this subject is to be regarded as Scriptural
which excludes Palestine from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
scope. To endeavour to make the Word
of God square with facts of history is
to tamper with Scripture and to run the
risk of obscuring its meaning and force.</p>

<p>The idea that the formation of the ten
kingdoms took place in the fifth century
fails to stand the test of Scripture in other
respects. Of the ten kings prophecy foretells
that "they receive authority as kings
with the beast for one hour," that they
"have one mind, and they give their power
and authority unto the beast" (Rev. 17.
13, 14). No such tenfold confederacy has
existed in Europe; it certainly never
existed among the chieftains of the Germanic
tribes which invaded the west of
the Roman Empire in the fifth century,
neither is there any record of such an
agreement among them. Nor, again, can
it be said that they made war with the
Lamb and were overcome by Him (v. 14).
These prophecies still await fulfilment.
Similar considerations apply to the passage
in Daniel 7 in reference to the fourth
kingdom. The ten kings, it is said, would
arise out of that kingdom, and after them
another king who would make war with the
saints and prevail against them until the
Ancient of Days came (vv. 21, 22, 24).</p>

<p>Again, since the persecution under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
king who arises after the others continues
until the Ancient of Days comes (v. 22),
his war against the saints must have lasted
from the fifth century until the present
time, if he arose in that century. Moreover,
as he was said to be going to subdue
three kingdoms (v. 24), the seven kingdoms
not so subdued must likewise have continued.
This has obviously not been the
case. From every point of view it is
impossible to assign the tenfold division
to any time in the past.</p>

<h3>THE OVERTHROW IN THE EAST:
THE TURKISH EMPIRE.</h3>


<p>Having narrated the disintegration of
the western half of the Empire, we will
now recount the events which involved
the overthrow of the eastern half. The
impoverishment of the imperial power
at Rome, and the weakening effect of the
Germanic attacks upon it, tended to enhance
the power of the Emperor at Constantinople.
Indeed the eastern Empire
was soon regarded as the more important
of the two, and for some time after the
barbarian invasions in Italy the Emperors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
at Constantinople claimed supremacy over
the west.</p>


<h4>Mohammed and the Khaliphs.</h4>

<p>The seventh century saw the ascendency
of Mohammed (born <small>A.D.</small> 570) in Arabia,
to which country his personal power,
temporal and religious, was limited. Upon
his death, in 632, his followers determined
on the invasion of Persia and the Asiatic
dominions of the Emperor at Constantinople.
Mohammed's successor, Abubekr,
the first of the Khaliphs (<i>i.e.</i>, "representatives"
of the prophet), at once waged war
in both directions. Persia speedily succumbed;
Syria and Palestine were subjugated
after seven years by the Khaliph
Omar. The reduction of Egypt followed, and
during the remainder of this century the
Saracens, the name by which the followers
of Mohammed became termed in Christendom,
extended their territory across the
entire length of North Africa, and shortly
afterwards even into Spain, where they
overpowered the then disunited Visigoths.</p>

<p>The Saracen power in Western Asia was
distracted during the next century by civil
war, and was further weakened by unsuccessful
wars against the Greeks. At
length, in 750, the seat of government was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
moved from Damascus to Bagdad. From
the eighth century onward, though the
religion of Mohammed gained ground, and
continues to do so to-day, the empire
established by his followers dwindled
rapidly, one province after another shaking
off its allegiance until at the end of the
tenth century its shattered dominions lay
open to the nearest invader. The foe appeared
in the shape of the formidable Turk.</p>


<h4>Eastern Empire at End of 10th Century.</h4>

<p>In view of the entrance of this new
enemy we may note the extent of the
territory belonging at this time to the
eastern branch of the old Roman world,
the Byzantine Empire, as it is termed (from
Byzantium, the ancient name of Constantinople).
The Eastern Emperors had
recovered some of their lost ground in
Asia, and at the close of the tenth century
they held all Asia Minor, Armenia, a part
of Syria, a considerable portion of Italy,
and all the Balkan Peninsula.</p>


<h4>The Appearance of the Turks.</h4>

<p>Beyond the north-eastern border of
the Saracen dominions lay the country of
Turkestan, inhabited by the Turks, a
branch of the warlike nation of the Tartars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of Central Asia. With them the Saracens,
after the establishment of their Government
at Bagdad, waged successful warfare
for a time, taking numbers of Turks
captive and dispersing them over the
Empire. This only facilitated the eventual
downfall of the Saracen sovereignty. The
Turks in Western Asia grew in influence,
and at length the Turkish troops, breaking
into open revolt, assumed control over the
Khaliphate, deposing and nominating the
Khaliphs at their will.</p>


<h4>The Turks Embrace Mohammedanism.</h4>

<p>Early in the eleventh century the bulk
of the Turkish nation, under its leader
Tongrol Bek, moving out from Turkestan,
swept down upon Persia. The
Khaliphate at Bagdad was, however, permitted
to remain, and not only so, but
Tongrol Bek and all his tribes embraced
the Mohammedan religion. The invaders
then marched west in vast numbers to
make an attack upon Christendom, and in
the course of time subdued Armenia and
most of Asia Minor. Europe became
alarmed, and the Byzantine Emperors
eagerly sought the assistance of the nations
of the west. Hence arose the Crusades,
which had as their chief object the deliverance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of Palestine from both Saracens
and Turks, and which served to retard,
though not to prevent, the advance of the
Turkish power in Europe.</p>


<h4>The Turks Enter Europe.</h4>

<p>Early in the thirteenth century a mighty
movement of Mongols south-west from
Central Asia, involving the immediate destruction
of the Khaliphate at Bagdad,
exerted an important influence upon the
Turks, in driving those Turkish tribes
which had remained east of Armenia westward
into Asia Minor. This resulted in the
establishment of various Turkish dynasties
in that country. At the close of the
thirteenth century the paramount power
over these was exercised by Osman (or
Othman, whence the name Ottoman),
who seized all that remained of the ancient
Roman world in Asia, and thus practically
founded the Ottoman Empire. In the
middle of the fourteenth century the way
was opened for the Ottomans to advance
into Europe. They were invited by one
of the rival factions at Constantinople to
undertake their cause. The Turks accordingly
crossed the Hellespont and
seized Gallipoli and the territory in the
vicinity of the capital. Constantinople<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
itself was left unattacked for the time.
Under Murad I., the grandson of Osman,
Roumania and several kingdoms south
of the Danube, including Bulgaria, were
subdued. The kings of Hungary, Bosnia
and Serbia rose against the invader, but
were severely defeated, and by the decisive
victory of Kosovo, in 1389, Serbia and
Bosnia were annexed.</p>


<h4>Constantinople Taken.</h4>

<p>Constantinople was temporarily saved
by another advance of the Mongol Tartars
upon the Turkish dominions in Asia, where,
in 1402, the Ottomans suffered a severe
defeat. From this check they recovered,
and during the first part of the fifteenth
century were at war with the Hungarians
and neighbouring races, whom they eventually
overthrew. In 1451 Mohammed II.
ascended the Ottoman throne, and in
1453 led an immense army against Constantinople.
The city was taken by storm,
the last of the Roman Emperors of the
east died fighting, and Mohammed II.
rode in triumph to the cathedral of St.
Sophia, where he established the Moslem
worship.</p>

<p>For over a hundred years after this the
Turkish Empire continued to extend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Egypt was annexed in 1517, and in the
middle of this century Tripoli and Algeria
were added, as well as considerable districts
in Europe and Asia. The Turks were now
at the zenith of their power.</p>


<h4>A Comparison of the Two Divisions.</h4>

<p>Recapitulating, we may compare the
two divisions of the Roman Empire
since their overthrow, from the <i>prophetic</i>,
<i>religious</i> and <i>political</i> standpoints. From
the <i>prophetic</i> point of view our interest in
the west has thus far centred in the fact
that the ten kingdoms were not formed by
the fifth century invasions; our interest in
the east centres chiefly in the land of
Palestine, wrenched, as we have seen, from
the eastern Emperor by the Saracens, and
then occupied by the Turks, who still
possess it. From the <i>religious</i> standpoint,
the Germanic tribes in the west accepted
Roman Catholicism, hence its progress
in that part of Europe; in the east the
Turks had accepted Mohammedanism when
invading the Empire of the Khaliphs, hence
the establishment of Islamism throughout
the Turkish dominions. <i>Politically</i>, the
western invasion in the fifth century, and
the consequent amalgamation of the Teutonic
tribes with the peoples formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
under Roman control, led eventually to
the formation of the various mediaeval
monarchies of Western Europe which are
to-day either kingdoms or republics.
Affairs in the eastern half of the Roman
world have moved more slowly in this
respect, owing to the prolonged existence
of the Ottoman Empire. The slow decay
of the Turkish power from the middle of
the sixteenth century onward has already
resulted in the formation of some Eastern
States, and the process still continues.</p>


<h4>The Decline of the Turkish Empire.</h4>

<p>The decline of the power of the Turks
set in during the latter half of the sixteenth
century, when their dominions passed under
incapable rulers. In the reign of Selim II.
(1566-1574) occurred the first conflict between
the Turks and Russians, the former
being driven back from Astrakkan. In
1593, during a war between Turkey and
Austria, the provinces of Transylvania,
Moldavia, and Wallachia rose in revolt.
As the result of intermittent wars in the
latter half of the seventeenth century
Austria acquired almost the whole of
<i>Hungary</i>. In 1770 Russia occupied <i>Moldavia</i>
and <i>Wallachia</i>, which though nominally
for a time under Turkey were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
practically Russian protectorates. During
the next few years Russia regained the
Crimea and all the neighbouring district
north of the Black Sea. At the commencement
of the nineteenth century the Ottoman
Empire was in a perilous condition.
Napoleon had plans for its partition. Provincial
governors were everywhere acting
independently of the Sultan. In 1804
<i>Serbia</i> revolted, and after a few years of
persistent struggle obtained its autonomy.
<i>Greece</i> revolted in 1820, and, though subdued
for a time, gained its independence
in 1829 through the intervention of
England, France, and Russia, and chiefly
as the result of the naval battle of Navarino,
in which the Turco-Egyptian fleet was
annihilated. In the same year <i>Algeria</i>
was annexed by the French. European
rivalries prevented for a time any rapid
diminution of the Empire.</p>

<p>The Crimean War of 1854-5 had important
consequences for the Balkan peoples. It
gave them, under the slackening grasp of the
Porte, twenty years of comparatively quiet
national development. In 1860 Wallachia
and Moldavia formed themselves into the
single state of <i>Roumania</i>. In 1866 the
Pasha of Egypt assumed the title of
Khedive (<i>i.e.</i>, king), thereby securing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
measure of independence for the country.
In 1875 the misrule of the Sultan led to
the insurrection of Bosnia, Herzegovina,
and Bulgaria. Serbia and Montenegro
then took up arms. In 1877 a war with
Russia saw Turkey without an ally. A
complete Russian victory in 1878 issued
in the treaties first of San Stefano and then
of Berlin, by which Turkey yielded to
Russia the state of <i>Bessarabia</i> and districts
south of the Caucasus, the independence
of <i>Serbia</i>, <i>Montenegro</i>, and <i>Roumania</i> were
recognised by the Porte, <i>Bulgaria</i> was
constituted an autonomous state, <i>Bosnia</i>
and <i>Herzegovina</i> were ceded to Austria,
<i>Thessaly</i> to Greece, and <i>Cyprus</i> to Britain.
In 1885, as the result of a revolution,
Eastern <i>Roumelia</i> became united to Bulgaria.
Shortly after that date German
influence began to gain ascendancy at the
court of the Sultan, and, among other
affairs, largely dominated the granting of
railway concessions in Western Asia.
The effects of that influence have been
evidenced in the present war. In 1912
Italy annexed <i>Tripoli</i> after a brief war.
In 1913 a short but sanguinary war with
the Balkan States deprived Turkey of
all her European dominions save for a
small piece of territory in the vicinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of Constantinople. <i>Egypt</i>, which has
been chiefly under British control for a
considerable period, has in 1915 been
practically annexed by Britain as a protectorate,
the Khedive being deposed and
a nominee of the British Government
being placed in authority. Britain has
likewise annexed a district north of the
Persian Gulf.</p>


<h4>The Coming Overthrow.</h4>

<p>The continual decrease of the Turkish
Empire, and more especially during the
past hundred years, affords ground, apart
from other considerations, for the expectation
of its overthrow and the
eventual cession of Palestine to the Jews,
perhaps by a general agreement among the
European Powers, events which seem not
far distant. National jealousies would not
permit the permanent annexation of Palestine
by any one of these Powers, in whatever
way the remaining Asiatic Turkish
dominions may be divided. A proposal
has already been put forward for its
annexation to Egypt. Such an arrangement
would in any case be merely temporary.
To the Jews the land belongs,
and by Divine decree the Jews are to possess
it again.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h4>A Blank in Prophecy.</h4>

<p>It should be observed, in passing, that
Scripture is apparently silent concerning
the occupation of Palestine by the
Saracens and Turks. Such silence is
noticeable when we remember how definitely
the occupation by the other Gentile
powers, the Chaldean, Medo-Persian,
Greek, and Roman, and the order and
character of their rule, were predicted.
The cause of the silence is not difficult to
ascertain. The four Gentile powers just
mentioned had to do with the Jews as the
recognised possessors of Palestine, either by
way of removing them from their country
or restoring them to it, or during such
time as they were permitted to remain
in it with liberty to continue their temple
worship and sacrifice. The Chaldeans
removed the Jews from the land, the Medo-Persians
repatriated them, the Greeks
permitted their continuance in it, the
Romans did so too, until <small>A.D.</small> 70, when
they crushed them. When, however, the
Saracens and the Turks seized the land
the Jews had been scattered, nor have
they received national recognition while
under them. Gentile occupation of Palestine
during such times as the Jews remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in their present condition seems therefore
to receive no direct notice in prophecy.</p>

<p>The restoration of Palestine to the Jews
is closely connected with the revival of the
Roman Empire in its tenfold form. Prior
to considering the manner of this revival we
must notice how during the period between
the overthrow of that Empire and its
coming resuscitation, its dominions and
their government have remained Roman in
character, thus affording a further proof
that the coming and final world-power will
not be entirely a new one, but will be a
revival of the ancient Roman or fourth
empire indicated in the prophecies of Daniel.</p>


<h4>The Continuation of Roman Government
and Influence.</h4>

<p>Such was the prestige of the Roman
name and authority that the chieftains of
the Germanic tribes which in the fifth
century subdued the western half of the
Empire governed the conquered territories,
not so much as tribal chiefs, but as
successors to, and in continuation of, the
imperial rule; they introduced no radical
changes in the provincial and municipal
forms of government of their predecessors.
Civil organisation remained distinctly
Roman, and has continued so; upon it are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
based some of the chief municipal institutions
of modern life. Indeed Roman
civil law still remains the foundation of
modern jurisprudence.</p>

<p>In south-eastern Europe, too, countries
which were for centuries under the
power of the Turk retained, in their
municipal institutions and organisation,
the impress of Roman authority. It
should be remembered that though the
eastern or Byzantine portion of the ancient
Roman Empire was distinct from the
western, its emperors being designated as
Grecian in contrast to the Roman, yet its
legislative foundations were laid in the
Roman Empire prior to the division of the
east from the west. Byzantine imperialism
was therefore really Roman under an
eastern title. According as the states in
the east have become freed from the Turkish
yoke, so the character of their government
and legislation has conformed in a large
degree to those of the west. The further
diminution of the Turkish Empire will
doubtless see a corresponding revival of
western conditions and methods.</p>


<h4>Roman Imperialism Continued.</h4>

<p>It is important also to observe that notwithstanding
the passing away of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Roman Empire as such, the principle of
imperialism remained, and, amidst the
vicissitudes of national government in
Europe, has continued to the present time.
The imperial power in the west was not
abolished when in 476 the last Roman
Emperor was deposed. On the contrary,
there was a kind of reunion imperially of
the west with the east. For a considerable
time the tribal kings of the west received
recognition from the eastern emperors, and
were regarded as their associates in imperial
control. This was the case even with
the Saxon kings in Britain, and on Saxon
coins may be seen to-day the same title,
<i>basileus</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, king), as was borne by the
emperors at Constantinople. Italy itself
was wrested from the Teutons by the
eastern Emperor Justinian in the sixth
century, and remained under the Byzantine
Caesars till 731.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Roman Senate continued
to exercise its authority, and in 800 chose
the Frankish king Charlemagne as their
sovereign. He was already ruling over the
greater part of Western Europe, and was
now crowned as Emperor at Rome by the
Pope. Though his empire fell to pieces
after his death, his dominions retained, and
have since retained, their Roman character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>Consideration of space forbids our tracing
here the further continuance of imperialism
as a factor in European politics. Recent
history and present-day events indicate
how rapidly we are approaching its final
development at the close of the times of
the Gentiles. The coming confederacy of
European states will not result in the formation
of a new empire, but will be the
revival of the Roman in an altered form.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter V.</span></h2>

<h3>THE COMING REVIVAL OF THE
ROMAN EMPIRE.</h3>


<p class="center">(1) <i>The Geographical Standpoint.</i></p>

<p>The coming revival of the Roman
Empire will for our present purpose
be best considered from the geographical,
political, and religious standpoints.</p>


<h4>Geographical Considerations.</h4>

<p>Any forecast of the exact delimitations
of the ten kingdoms constituting the reconstructed
Empire must necessarily be
largely conjectural. That their aggregate
area will precisely conform to that of the
ancient Roman Empire does not necessarily
follow from the fact of its revival,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and cannot be definitely concluded from
Scripture. An extension of the territories
of the Empire in its resuscitated form
would be quite consistent with the retention
of its identity. Moreover, if Roman
imperialism may be considered to have continued
in the hands of Teutonic monarchs
after the fall of the western part of the
Empire in 476, if, for instance, Charles the
Great, of whom we have spoken (p. 58),
ruled as a Roman Emperor, despite the
passing away of the actual Empire itself,
then the dominions which were under the
rule of these later monarchs may yet be
found incorporated in the Empire, and so
form parts of the ten kingdoms. In that
case Germany and Holland would be included.
Possibly, too, the Empire will
embrace all the territories which belonged
to the three which preceded it, the Grecian,
Medo-Persian, and Chaldean. Certainly
when the stone fell on the toes of the image,
the whole image, representing these former
three as well as the fourth, was demolished.
Suggestive also in this respect is the fact
that the beast in the vision recorded in
Revelation 13. 2 was possessed of features
of the leopard, the bear, and the lion, the
same beasts which represented in Daniel's
vision the Grecian, Medo-Persian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Chaldean kingdoms (Dan. 7. 4-6), the
order in Revelation 13 being inverted.
While political characteristics are doubtless
chiefly in view in these symbols, there may
at the same time be an indication of the
eventual incorporation of the first three
empires in the fourth. It must be remembered,
too, that the authority of the
federal head of the ten kingdoms is to be
world-wide: "There was given to him
authority over every tribe and people and
tongue and nation" (Rev. 13. 7). It is
probable, therefore, that while the ten
kingdoms will occupy a well defined area,
their dependencies and the countries which
are allied with them will embrace practically
the remainder of the world.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the Roman Empire
is to be reconstructed in exact conformity
territorially with its ancient boundaries&mdash;such
a reconstruction is, of course,
not inconceivable&mdash;we must consider what
period of the conquests of the ancient
Empire to take, whether under the first
emperor, Augustus, or during the Apostolic
Age, or later. We may, perhaps, be
helped by the facts already mentioned,
that prophecy relating to Gentile dominion
is focussed upon the Jews and Palestine,
and has especially in view the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the nation in their land. Now, shortly
after their overthrow, in <small>A.D.</small> 70, their
national recognition as possessors of the
land ceased. This period, moreover, corresponds
broadly to the close of the Apostolic
Age. The dispersion of the Jews
among the nations was completed by
Adrian in the next century. He desolated
the whole of Palestine, expelling all the
remaining Jewish inhabitants.</p>


<h4>A Review of the Ancient Territories.</h4>

<p>We will therefore now review the limits
of the Empire and of some of its provinces at
that time, noticing certain circumstances
of past and present history suggestive of
future issues. In doing so we are not predicting
that the boundaries of the revived
Empire will be those of the ancient.</p>

<p>Commencing with North Africa, it will
be observed, on referring to the map, that
practically the same strip of territory
which belonged to the Roman Empire in
the times of the apostles has passed directly
under the government of countries which
were themselves then within the Empire.
For Spain rules over Morocco, France over
Algeria and Tunis, Italy recently seized
Tripoli, and Britain has, since Turkey's
entrance into the great war, virtually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
taken possession of Egypt. It seems not
a little significant that no country which
was outside the limits of the Empire
at the time under consideration has been
permitted by God to annex these North
African territories since the Saracens and
the Turks were dispossessed of them.</p>

<p>Passing now to Asia, the territory in
that continent which belonged to Rome in
the first century is approximately what
remained to Turkey immediately prior to
the present war. Mesopotamia and most
of Armenia were included. The war has
already seen Turkey dispossessed of portions
of these. The downfall of the Turkish
Empire would almost certainly involve
territorial rearrangements of deepest import
in the light of prophecy, especially
as regards Palestine.</p>


<h4>Divisions of the Greek Empire: A
Possible Renewal.</h4>

<p>The 8th chapter of Daniel apparently
indicates that the Asiatic territories of the
Empire will be divided much as they were
under the Greeks after the death of Alexander
the Great. He was obviously symbolised
by the great horn (v. 22). The
four horns which came up in its place (v.
8) are clearly, too, the four generals who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
succeeded Alexander, and among whom
his dominions were divided, Cassander
ruling over Macedonia and Greece, Lysimachus
over part of Asia Minor and
Thrace (the extent of the latter province
was almost exactly what now belongs to
Turkey in Europe), Seleucus over most of
Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia, and the
east, and Ptolemy over Egypt. Next
follows a prediction carrying us to events
which are evidently yet future. It is said,
for instance, that these events will take
place "in the latter time of their kingdom
(not, it will be observed, in the time of the
four kings themselves who succeeded
Alexander, but of the kingdoms over
which they ruled), when the transgressors
are come to the full" (v. 23). The expressions
in this chapter, "the time of the
end" (v. 17), "the latter time of the indignation,"
"the appointed time of the
end" (v. 19), and "the latter time of their
kingdom" (v. 23), all point to a period still
future, namely, to the close of the present
age. Again, in reference to the "king of
fierce countenance," while much of the
prophecy can be applied to Antiochus
Epiphanes in the second century <small>B.C.</small>, yet
no man has hitherto arisen whose character
and acts have been precisely those related in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
verses 9-12 and 23-25. We may also compare
what is said of "the transgression
that maketh desolate" (v. 13) with the
Lord's prophecy concerning the abomination
of desolation (Matt. 24. 15-22), a
prophecy which also manifestly awaits
fulfilment.</p>

<p>Possibly, therefore, these Asiatic territories
will be similarly divided in the
coming time. In regard to the first of the
above-mentioned four divisions, the recent
extension of Greece to include the ancient
province of Macedonia is remarkable. This
was an outcome of the Balkan War of 1912.
The boundaries of Greece are now approximately
what they were under Cassander
in the time of the Grecian Empire, what
they were also later as the provinces of
Macedonia and Achaia in the Roman
Empire. There has lately, therefore, been
a significant reversion to ancient conditions
in this respect.</p>


<h4>Other European Territories.</h4>

<p>Coming now to the dual-monarchy of
Austria-Hungary, reference to the map of
the Roman Empire in the Apostolic Age
will show that what are now Hungary,
Transylvania, Bessarabia, and other states
of the present monarchy were without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Roman boundaries, while Pannonia, or
what is now Austria west of the Danube,
was within; even when in the next century
Dacia (now Transylvania, Bessarabia, &amp;c.)
was annexed, the two parts of the present
dual kingdom were separate. The separation
of Hungary from Austria has for
a considerable time been a practical
question of European politics, and may be
hastened by present events.</p>

<p>The northern and north-eastern boundaries
of Italy embraced the Trentino and
the peninsula of Istria. Noticeable, therefore,
are the present efforts of Italy to
acquire these very districts, efforts which
seem likely to achieve success. Roman
states north of Italy covered what are now
Baden, Wurtemberg, Luxemberg, and a
large part of Bavaria. The possibility
of an eventual severance of these from
Prussian domination has been much discussed
of late.</p>

<p>The Rhenish provinces of Alsace and
Lorraine, originally portions of the Roman
province of Gallia (now France), were
snatched from France by Germany in the
Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. Their
recovery is a supreme object of the efforts
of the French in the present war, and not
without hope of success.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>


<h4>The British Empire.</h4>

<p>As to Britain, at the time under consideration
the greater part of the island
was definitely included in the Roman
Empire. Ireland and most of Scotland
were never conquered by the Romans.
Should Britain form one of the ten kingdoms,
there is nothing to show that Ireland
or any other part of the British Empire
must of necessity be absolutely separated
from it. Self-government may yet be
possessed by those territories which have
not yet received it, and it is significant
that Ireland has now practically obtained
it. That the lands which are linked with
Britain as dependencies, or as in possession
of self-government, should remain as integral
parts of the Empire is but consistent
with the coming world-wide authority of
the potentate who will be the federal head
of the ten kingdoms. And that each state
in the British Empire should have its own
local government is, on the other hand,
consistent with the establishment of a
closer and complete confederacy of ten
kingdoms, the area of which may correspond
largely to that of the ancient Roman
Empire. In contrast to the self-government
of the other countries of the world at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the coming period, the ten united kingdoms
will eventually be absolutely under
the control of the final emperor just
mentioned, for the ten kings over these
states, who receive authority as kings
with him, will be of one mind to give their
power and authority and their kingdom
to him (Rev. 17. 12, 13, 17).</p>

<p>What has been said of the British
Empire may be true also of others of the
ten kingdoms which have colonies or dependencies,
and thus, while the ten kingdoms
will themselves constitute an Empire,
their alliances and treaties with other
countries of the world will apparently
involve an extension of the authority of
the controlling despot "over every tribe
and people and tongue and nation" (Rev.
13. 7). If, for instance, the United States
of America were at that time in alliance
with Britain (quite a possible contingency),
their joint influence would probably extend
to the whole of the American continents,
which would thereby acknowledge his
authority.</p>

<p>We may observe, too, the way in which
the continent of Africa has come under
certain European influences in modern
times. The mention of this is simply
suggestive. That the Scripture will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
absolutely fulfilled is beyond doubt; the
exact mode of its accomplishment is known
to God.</p>


<p class="center">(2) <i>The Political Standpoint.</i></p>


<h4>European Federation.</h4>

<p>Agencies are already at work for the
establishment of a confederacy of European
States&mdash;not the least significant of the many
signs that the end of the age is approaching.
The movement towards confederacy is
doubtless receiving an impetus from the
great upheaval in Europe. A circular
issued in December, 1914, and distributed
far and wide, announced the formation of
a committee of influential men with the
object of promoting a "European Federation."
The circular says: "In sight of the
present situation of ruin it ought to be the
general opinion that a firmer economical
and political tie is of utmost importance
for all nations without exception, and that
particularly for Europe the narrower bond
of a federation, based on equality and interior
independence of all partaking states,
is of urgent necessity, which public opinion
ought to demand."</p>

<p>A pamphlet published by the Committee
recommends that the union of states shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
be economical, political, and legal, with
an international army as a common
guarantee, and that European Federation
should become the principal and most
urgent political battle-cry for the masses
of all European nations, and declares that
"when the Governments are willing, when
the public opinion of all peoples forces
them to be willing, there is no doubt but
that a reasonable and practical union of
nations will prove to be as possible and
natural as is at present a union of provinces,
cantons, territories, whose populations
often show more difference of race and
character than those of nations now at
hostilities." The Committee calls upon
the peoples of Europe to suffer the diplomatists
no longer to dispose of them like
slaves and by militarism to lash them
to fury against each other. It calls upon
them to see to it that never and nowhere
should a member of any body or Government
be elected who is not an advocate
of the Federation, and that the trade
union, society, or club to which any individual
belongs should express sympathy
with the movement in meetings and in
votes. "The people," it is said, "have it
now in their power, more than ever before,
to control the Powers."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>


<h4>Two Possible Ways of Federation.</h4>

<p>The formation of ten federated states,
covering at least the area of the ancient
Empire at the end of the first century of
the present era, may be effected in two
ways, either by the peaceful methods of
arbitration and treaty, or as a result of
strife and confusion. That the present
European War will be succeeded by
efforts for the creation of permanent international
harmony and universal peace is
probable, as is also some attempt at such a
federation as is proposed by the above-mentioned
Committee. On the other hand,
sinister indications abound to-day which
point to industrial strife and revolution
rather than peace. The condition of the
industrial world presents a gloomy prospect
indeed. There are ominous signs of
keener conflict than ever between capital
and labour. The forces of Socialism,
Syndicalism, Communism, &amp;c., are rapidly
increasing in power and in international
activity, and their avowed aims presage
anything but peace in the near future. We
may take, for example, the declared objects
of "The Alliance of the Social Democracy"&mdash;now
incorporated in the International
Working Men's Association&mdash;"To destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
all States and all Churches with all their
institutions and laws, religious, political,
juridical, financial, magisterial, academical,
economical, and social, and to establish
in their place industrial co-operation
and collective ownership of land and
capital." All this sounds very pretentious,
and would probably fail of complete accomplishment,
but the agencies at work for it
are strong. Attempts on a large scale
would certainly lead to unprecedented
disorder and chaos.</p>


<h4>The Sea Symbolic of National
Unrest.</h4>

<p>Not improbably the ten kingdoms of
the reconstructed Roman Empire will
arise as a result of political and social confusion.
Thus it was in the case of the
French Revolution and the consequent
uprising of Napoleon. A repetition of
such events on a far wider scale in the
future is quite conceivable. In the prophetic
vision given to the Apostle John,
the beast was seen "coming up out of the
sea" (Rev. 13. 1). Now the sea is in
Scripture used figuratively of the nations,
its characteristic restlessness symbolising
their commotion and strife. Compare the
words of Isaiah: "Ah, the uproar of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
peoples, which roar like the roaring of the
seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush
like the rushing of many waters! The nations
shall rush like the rushing of many waters:
but He shall rebuke them" (Isa. 17. 12, 13;
see also Psa. 65. 7; and Ezek. 26. 3). To
national unrest the Lord Jesus applied
similar language when He foretold to the
disciples that there would be "upon the
earth distress of nations, in perplexity for
the roaring of the sea and the billows; men
fainting for fear, and for expectation of the
things which are coming on the world"
(Luke 21. 25, 26). So also the waters
which John had seen in his vision are described
by the angel as "peoples, and
multitudes, and nations, and tongues"
(Rev. 17. 15). Daniel, too, saw the four
great beasts come up from the sea as a
result of the breaking forth of the four
winds of the Heaven upon it, an undoubted
representation of a condition of national
disturbance (Dan. 7. 2, 3). That the beast
of Revelation 13. 1 was seen coming up out of
the sea points, therefore, to the probability
that the ten kings who will have brief
authority over the revived Empire will
be raised to their kingdom, not by
constitutional methods, but as the
result of revolutions and the collapse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
present-day governments and institutions.</p>


<h4>Revolutions and their Issues.</h4>

<p>Should any great measure of success
attend the syndicalist and communist
movements of the day, and especially if
they are internationalised, the inevitable
revolutions and disorder would almost
certainly issue, as revolutions have so
frequently issued, in despotism and autocracy,
and perhaps in this way the ten
kings would arise. The overthrow of the
governments in the countries involved
would remove what has certainly been the
great restraint upon lawlessness<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> from the
times of the apostles until now. Everything
would be ripe for the appearance of a
universal potentate. The cry would arise
for "a man," a controlling organiser to
bring order out of chaos. The unstable
character of the rule of the ten kings, and
the impoverishment of their kingdoms,
would lead them, as a matter of diplomacy,
to hand over their authority to him.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> See "The Epistles to the Thessalonians, with Notes
Exegetical and Expository," by C. F. Hogg and W. E. Vine,
note <i>c.</i> pp. 259, 260. (Glasgow: Pickering &amp; Inglis. 3/9, p.f.)</p></div>


<h4>The Iron and the Clay.</h4>

<p>The political constitution of the successive
empires during "the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Gentiles" was indicated in the image of
Nebuchadnezzar's vision by the various
substances of which the parts of the image
were composed. While the regular deterioration
in the relative value of these
substances is noticeable, we are concerned
now with those of the legs and feet. The
legs were of iron, and the feet part of iron
and part of potter's clay, not moist or
miry clay, but "earthenware" (Dan. 2.
41, <small>R.V.</small>, margin), and consequently
brittle (v. 42, margin).</p>

<p>That the iron symbolised militarism
seems clear from what is said of the fourth
kingdom, that "as iron breaketh in pieces
and subdueth all things: and as iron that
crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces
and crush" (v. 40). Nations are broken
and crushed by military power, and thus
the nations were treated by the Romans.
This was further signified by the iron
teeth of the fourth beast, as is definitely
stated in Daniel 7. 19, 23: "And shall
devour the whole earth, and shall tread it
down, and break it in pieces."</p>

<p>The supposition that the clay represents
democracy is gratuitous and arbitrary.
The early Roman Empire, symbolised by
the legs of the image, was built up under
democratic rule. When republicanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
was superseded by imperialism, democratic
principles still prevailed. Democracy,
therefore, played its part from the very
commencement of the fourth kingdom,
and had it been symbolised by the clay,
not only the feet and toes but the legs
themselves would have consisted of mingled
iron and clay. Moreover, democracy in
the generally accepted sense of the term
has not always been found to be of an
unstable or brittle character; witness the
republicanism of the United States. Democracies,
too, may be established on
strictly constitutional principles.</p>

<p>Another explanation, therefore, of the
symbolism of the clay must be sought,
and it is not unlikely to be found in those
revolutionary principles to which we have
already referred, which were evidenced at
the time of the French Revolution, and
are finding expression, though in greater
variety to-day, in such projects as those
of the International Working Men's Association.
Certainly the masses of the
people of Europe are being permeated
both by militarism and by the revolutionary
doctrines of which we have spoken.
Should these principles spread among the
civil services and forces, everything would
be in a complete state of preparedness for</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<h4>Unprecedented Political and Social
Upheaval</h4>

<p>which would effect the overthrow of present
forms of government. From the world's
point of view the situation would require
a consummate genius with powers of world-wide
organisation. Doubtless Satan's
masterpiece of infidel ingenuity would be
at hand for the occasion.</p>

<p>We are not predicting that this is to be
the manner of the revival of the Empire
and of the advent of its imperial head.
We have merely suggested possible circumstances
in the light of Scripture and
present-day movements. The actual circumstances
attending the rise of the ten
kings and their Emperor must for the time
remain conjectural. Certainly these kings
will receive authority with him for one
hour (Rev. 17. 12), a phrase which may be
translated "at the same time;" and
certainly they will agree to give their
power and authority to him (v. 13).</p>


<p class="center">(3) <i>The Religious Standpoint.</i></p>

<p>We will now note the religious conditions
which are to prevail for a time
upon the resuscitation of the Empire.
These are plainly indicated for us in
Revelation 17. The apostle sees a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sitting on the seven-headed and ten-horned
beast. The woman is gorgeously
arrayed, holds in her hand a golden cup
full of abominations, and is drunken with
the blood of the saints. Her name, written
on her forehead, is</p>


<h4>"Mystery, Babylon the Great,"</h4>

<p>"the mother of the harlots and of the
abominations of the earth" (vv. 3-6).
The woman is symbolically described as
the city of Rome (v. 18), and that leads
on to a second mention of Babylon, in
chapter 18, and a new description. Now
to the description of the woman in chapter
17 nothing more closely corresponds than
the Papacy. But if the Babylon of chapter
17 is to be identified with that of chapter 18,
the Papacy answers to the whole description
only to a limited extent. While,
however, there is much in common in the
two descriptions in these chapters, yet the
two Babylons are possibly to be distinguished.
The Babylon of chapter 17 is
a "mystery," not so that of chapter 18.
Again, the destruction of the one is different
from that of the other. The first will be
destroyed by the ten kings and their
emperor (17. 16), the second by the direct
judgment of God (18. 5, 8, 20); the first as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the result of human antagonism, the
second by famine, fire and earthquake.
We are perhaps, therefore, justified in
taking the more limited view in connection
with the circumstances of chapter 17.
Even so the woman may be regarded as
representing the apostate sacerdotal systems
which have sprung from the Papacy
as well as that system itself.</p>

<p>The position of the woman indicates an
exercise of power which is voluntarily
supported by the beast. That she sits upon
the waters implies her religious dominion
over the nations; that she is carried by the
beast, who rules over the nations politically,
implies that there will be a complete
alliance between her and the ten kings
with their chief, and that the sphere of her
influence will be co-extensive with the
dominions of the beast.</p>


<h4>The Papacy: Its Present Power.</h4>

<p>Now though the Papacy lost its temporal
power in 1870, it is far from having lost its
political influence. Ecclesiastically, too,
though it has received various set-backs, it
is manifestly gaining power. This is
especially observable, for example, in
Britain, the overthrow of which as a
Protestant Power is undoubtedly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
object of the persistent aggressiveness of
Romanism. This aggressiveness is manifest
in all the dominions of the British
Empire, as well as in other lands.</p>

<p>Again, while certain governments have of
late shaken off the ecclesiastical yoke, and
infidelity has spread among the people of
Roman Catholic lands, the number of
Roman Catholics has increased with great
rapidity. They were estimated at somewhat
over 200,000,000 twenty years ago,
they are now said to number about
300,000,000.</p>

<p>Indications are not wanting of a tendency
towards</p>


<h4>A Reunion of Christendom,</h4>

<p>which would be facilitated by a willingness
on the part of the Papacy to adapt itself
to the impulse of the time.</p>

<p>Present events, therefore, point to a
great renewal of Papal power involving
the fulfilment of the prophecy relating
to the woman and the beast that carries
her. This renewed alliance between the
political and the ecclesiastical powers
will, however, be of brief duration.
The successful efforts of governments in
recent times to liberate themselves from
Papal authority, as in the case of France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and Portugal, are but foreshadowings of
the eventual entire destruction of ecclesiasticism
and sacerdotalism under the
revived Roman Empire. "The ten horns
... and the beast, these shall hate the
harlot, and shall make her desolate and
naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall
burn her utterly with fire" (Rev. 17. 16).
Thus it would seem that, when at the
very zenith of its power and ambition,
the Papacy, at the head of amalgamated
Christendom, will suddenly meet
its doom.</p>


<h4>The Doom of Religious Babylon.</h4>

<p>Its accumulated wealth would probably
be an incentive in determining the ten
kings to take this step, owing possibly to
the impoverishment of their kingdoms as a
result of wars and political and social
upheavals. An additional cause will
doubtless be the widespread spirit of
antagonism against all religion.</p>

<p>Submission to the Papal yoke has invariably
had an aftermath of infidelity;
similarly the temporary subservience of
the beast to the woman will issue in the
casting off of all religious restraint and in
the universal acknowledgment of the
presumptuous claims of the world-ruler.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<h4>Satanic Authority of the Emperor.</h4>

<p>The authority of this final emperor of
the Roman kingdom will be Satanic. "The
dragon gave him his power, and his throne,
and great authority" (Rev. 13. 2); "the
beast ... was, and is not; and is about
to come up out of the abyss, and to go into
perdition" (Rev. 17. 8). This implies that
he has been on the earth in the past. The
same thing is indicated in the interpretation
of the seven heads. Topographically they
are described as seven mountains, personally
as seven kings (v. 9). Of these,
five had fallen, the sixth was in power in
John's time, the seventh had not then
come (v. 10). The beast (clearly here
symbolising, not a kingdom, but a person)
would be an eighth, and yet would be of the
seven (v. 11). These heads have been regarded
by some as forms of government, by
others as empires, or again, as emperors.
There seems to be no reason why they are
not to be regarded as emperors, though
doubtless their empires are in view, as
being associated with them. Accordingly,
the fact that the eighth is also one of the
seven indicates his reappearance on the
scene. Various suggestions have been
made as to his identification, but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
must remain uncertain until his advent.
With him the ten kings for a time receive
authority (v. 12), subsequently handing it
over to him with their kingdom (v. 17),
but not before they have together with him
crushed the great religious system symbolised
by the woman (v. 16). His
stupendous power and brilliant abilities,
the evidence of his superhuman origin,
his phenomenal capacity for organisation,
and the consolidation of the empire under
his absolute control will cause the whole
world to marvel at him (Rev. 13. 3; 17. 8).
To the world, in its divinely inflicted and
therefore retributive delusion, he will
appear like a god who has come to deliver
from woe, and to introduce the long-looked-for
age of peace and prosperity. Wonder
will be succeeded by worship, both of the
man and of Satan. "They worshipped the
dragon, because he gave his authority unto
the beast; and they worshipped the beast,
saying, Who is like unto the beast? and
who is able to war with him?" (13. 4).</p>

<p>The world is now in course of rapid
preparation for all this:</p>


<h4>The "Superman"</h4>

<p>has of late become a much discussed topic
in various classes of society and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
press, and the idea is supported by the
theories of evolution which are receiving
increasingly wide acceptance. A spirit
of expectancy is being thus aroused which
will undoubtedly facilitate the recognition
of the man himself at his advent, and the
acknowledgment of his claims to divine
honour. But this will involve the worship
of Satan, and to this end the effective
agency of</p>


<h4>Spiritism</h4>

<p>has been long at work. Spiritism leads to
devil worship. It must do so; its energising
power is Satan himself. Both spiritism
and theosophy, and similar forms of error,
all of which are rapidly on the increase
to-day, are paving the way for world-wide
worship of the dragon.</p>

<p>The imperial power and worship of this
emperor will be promoted by another
potentate similarly energised by Satan.
This latter is the second beast, described
in Revelation 13. 11-end. Later on in the
book he is called</p>


<h4>The False Prophet</h4>

<p>(Rev. 16. 13; 19. 20; 20. 10), indicating
that his activities are chiefly of a religious
character, and perhaps that he will be
more closely connected with Jewish affairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
He will make "the earth and them that
dwell therein worship the beast," the
emperor of the ten kingdoms (13. 11),
deceiving the world by supernatural signs
wrought in the presence of the first beast
(v. 12), and enforcing the worship of his
image (v. 15), the abomination of desolation
set up in the temple at Jerusalem
(Matt. 24. 15). With the worship of an
image the times of the Gentiles began
(Dan. 3. 1), and with similar idolatry
they will end. In the days of the early
Roman emperors their deification was
celebrated by the adoration of their images.
Then, as formerly under Nebuchadnezzar,
those who refused to worship suffered
death. So will it be under the final
emperor and his colleague.</p>

<p>Various opinions are held regarding these
two beasts of Revelation 13, as to which is
the Man of Sin spoken of by Paul in 2
Thessalonians 2, which the Antichrist
mentioned in John's Epistles, and which of
the two is the wilful king described in
Daniel 11. Limitations of space preclude
our entering into the subject in detail here.
The present writer holds the view that all
three are the same person, and that they
are also the same as the horn in Daniel
7. 8, 11, and as the first beast of Revelation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
13, and that these are all different
descriptions of the final head of the
revived Empire. The Old Testament
passages somewhat briefly announce the
arising of this world-wide ruler; the New
Testament passages unfold and expand the
preceding predictions concerning him,
among the additional details given in the
New Testament being the fact that he is to
have a prophet who will assiduously support
his claim to deity and his administration.
It is the world-emperor, and not his
prophet, who is to be worshipped, and who
therefore proclaims himself as God (2
Thess. 2. 4). His prophet, the second
beast of Revelation 13, in the exercise of
all the power of the first, will cause the
world to worship him (13. 12). As his
prophet and prime minister he would not
himself endeavour to usurp the position
of him whose avowed deity he seeks to
support.</p>

<p>The similarity of the details in the above-mentioned
passages indicates that the same
person is in view in each case. His blasphemies,
for instance, and his assumption
of deity are mentioned in Daniel 7. 25;
11. 36, 37; 2 Thessalonians 2. 3, 4, and
Revelation 13. 5, 6, and his war with the
saints in Daniel 7. 21, 25 and Revelation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
13. 7. Further, the blasphemous proclamation
of himself as God is consistent
with what is said in John's Epistles concerning
the Antichrist. For in his self-deification
he is directly "antagonistic to
Christ," he denies that Jesus is the Christ,
and therefore denies the Father and the
Son (1 John 2. 22).</p>

<p>The two potentates will establish not
only a universal religion, but also a</p>


<h4>Universal System of Commerce.</h4>

<p>The second beast "causeth all, the small
and the great, and the rich and the poor,
and the free and the bond, that there be
given them a mark on their hand, or upon
their forehead; and that no man should be
able to buy or to sell, save he that hath
the mark, even the name of the beast or the
number of his name" (Rev. 13. 16, 17).
This indicates a world-wide protectionist
system, such a system as, for instance,
might conceivably be established under
some form of syndicalism. Undeniably,
circumstances in the industrial world to-day
manifest an increasing tendency in
this direction. The principles previously
mentioned, as now making for industrial
and international revolution, and the
present stupendous movements towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
amalgamation, are clearly preparing for
the fulfilment of this prophecy by facilitating
the eventual establishment of the unrighteous
commercial system of the reconstituted
Empire.</p>

<h3>THE EVERLASTING KINGDOM.</h3>


<p>We have now to consider the dealings of
the two beasts, the final Roman emperor
and his false prophet, with</p>


<h4>The Jews.</h4>

<p>With the Romans the Jews joined in the
death of Christ, and with the rulers of
this fourth empire they will be in agreement
for a time at the close of their
long course of apostasy. This was especially
made known to Daniel in the prophecy
of</p>


<h4>The Seventy Weeks</h4>

<p>(Dan. 9). These weeks (lit., <i>hebdomads</i>, or
periods of seven, <i>i.e.</i>, seven years each)
had been divinely decreed (or "cut off,"
<i>i.e.</i>, from the period of "the times of the
Gentiles") upon his people and his city.
From the going forth of the commandment
to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Anointed One (the Messiah), the Prince,
would be seven weeks and threescore and
two weeks. After this the Anointed One
would be cut off, and would have nothing
(Dan. 9. 24-26). This period is 69 times 7,
or 483 years, and to the very day this was
the period commencing with the command
of Artaxerxes Longimanus, King of Persia,
for the restoration of Jerusalem (Neh.
2. 1-9), and ending with the triumphal
entry of Christ into the city (Matt. 21.
1-11).<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Four days later He was crucified,
"the Anointed One was cut off and had
nothing," <i>i.e.</i>, He did not enter then upon
His Messianic kingdom. The prophecy
predicted that the people of the prince (lit.,
"a prince") that would come would destroy
the city and the sanctuary. That
took place in <small>A.D.</small> 70, under Titus Vespasianus.
But Titus is not "the prince
that shall come." This, apart from other
considerations, is clear from what follows:
"And his (the prince's) end shall be with a
flood (or rather, 'in the overflowing,' <i>i.e.</i>,
of the wrath of God)," a prediction at once
inapplicable to Titus. The mention of</p>


<h4>The Last "Week"</h4>

<p>is deferred, indicating an interval between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the sixty-ninth and the seventieth.
Now the events predicted for the seventieth
had no historical fulfilment immediately
after the sixty-ninth. The one, therefore,
did not follow the other consecutively.
At the commencement of the intervening
period the Jews were scattered from their
land. At the seventieth they will have
been restored, and the events of that week
concern "the prince that shall come," the
last world-emperor, and his dealings with
them. "He shall make a firm covenant
with many (lit., 'the many,' <i>i.e.</i>, the
great majority of the nation) for one
week" (v. 27). This covenant is described
in Isaiah's prophecies as a "covenant with
death" and an "agreement with Hell."
The covenant, he says, "shall be disannulled,"
and the agreement "shall not
stand; when the overflowing scourge shall
pass through, then ye shall be trodden
down by it" (Isa. 28. 18). That this
refers to a time yet future and not to past
Israelitic history may be gathered from
verse 22, where the theme and the language
are similar to those of the passage in Daniel
now under consideration. Daniel tells us
the mode of the disannulling. "In the
midst of the week (<small>R.V.</small>, margin) he shall
cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Accordingly after three and a half years the
Antichrist, manifesting his real character,
will prove himself a traitor and break the
covenant, and thus Isaiah's prediction will
be fulfilled.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> See "The Coming Prince," by Sir Robert Anderson. Price, 5/.</p></div>

<p>Apparently at the very time when he
thus breaks his league with the Jews the
Antichrist will determine upon his public
deification and the establishment of his
worship in the Temple. For he it is who
"opposeth and exalteth himself above all
that is called God, or that is worshipped;
so that he as God sitteth in the Temple of
God, showing himself that he is God"
(2 Thess. 2. 4). This, with the setting up
of his image, will doubtless be the fulfilment
of the prophecies recorded by Daniel,
that "upon the wing (or pinnacle) of
abominations shall come one that maketh
desolate" (Dan. 9. 27, cp. 11. 31 and 12. 11),
and "they shall profane the sanctuary, even
the fortress, and shall take away the continual
burnt offering, and they shall set up
the abomination that maketh desolate"
(11. 31, cp. 12. 11); a fulfilment also of
the Lord's prediction that "the abomination
of desolation, which was spoken of
by Daniel the prophet," will "stand in
the holy place" (Matt. 24. 15). In the
establishment of this blasphemous worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of the emperor, the false prophet will play
a prominent part, as we have seen from
the latter part of Revelation 13.</p>

<p>The many references to the desolator
and the desolations are indicative of the</p>


<h4>Fierce Persecution</h4>

<p>which will follow. This will be at first
directed against "the remnant," the large
numbers of Jews who will repudiate
allegiance to the beast and to the false
prophet, many doubtless having been converted
to their coming Messiah through
the testimony of two witnesses who will
be sent from God to the nation. "They shall
prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore
days, clothed in sackcloth" (Rev.
11. 3-13). The success of their ministry
will apparently arouse the bitter antagonism
of Satan and his human instruments.
The breaking of the covenant with the
people as a whole indicates that an effort
will also be made to crush the entire nation.
Thus the latter half of the seventieth week
will be the time of "Jacob's trouble,"
"a time of trouble, such as never was
since there was a nation even to that same
time" (Dan. 12. 1), though the unprecedented
tribulation will not be confined
to the Jews only.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h4>Armageddon and After.</h4>

<p>The bitter antagonism of the man of
sin, and his colleague, the false
prophet, against God and His people
will culminate in the gathering together
of all the forces of the Empire in Palestine
in final conflict for the complete domination
of the world. This tremendous event is
thus indicated by the apostle John: "And
I saw coming out of the mouth of the
dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast,
and out of the mouth of the false prophet,
three unclean spirits, as it were frogs:
for they are the spirits of devils (correctly,
"demons"), working signs; which go forth
unto the kings of the whole world, to gather
them together unto the war of the great
day of God, the Almighty" (Rev. 16.
13, 14).</p>

<p>In reality the issue at stake will be the
supremacy of Christ or of Satan in the
earth. The objective will be neither
territorial conquest nor naval supremacy,
nor commercial predominance. The war
of the beast and the ten kings under
him is against the Lamb (Rev. 17. 14).
This the second Psalm had foretold: "Why
do the nations rage, and the peoples
imagine a vain thing? The kings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
earth set themselves, and the rulers take
counsel together against the Lord, and
against His Anointed, saying, Let us
break their bands asunder, and cast away
their cords from us." The issue is not
uncertain: "He that sitteth in the
Heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have
them in derision."</p>


<h4>The Scene of the Conflict</h4>

<p>is Har-Magedon, commonly known as
Armageddon (Rev. 16. 16). The name, which
is associated with Megiddo, a locality famed
in Old Testament history for its decisive
battles (Judges 5. 19; 2 Kings 23), doubtless
stands here for a wider area, stretching, as
we shall see, from the north to the south
of the land.</p>

<p>The combatants, the conflict and its
conclusion, are described by John in vivid
language of terrible grandeur in Revelation
19. 11-21: "And I saw the Heaven opened;
and behold, a white horse, and He that sat
thereon, called Faithful and True; and in
righteousness He doth judge and make war.
And His eyes are a flame of fire, and upon
his head are many diadems; and He hath a
name written, which no one knoweth but
He Himself. And He is arrayed in a garment
sprinkled with blood: and His name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
is called the Word of God. And the armies
which are in Heaven followed Him upon
white horses, clothed in fine linen, white
and pure. And out of His mouth proceedeth
a sharp sword, that with it He
should smite the nations: and He shall rule
them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the
winepress of the fierceness of the wrath
of Almighty God. And He hath on His
garment and on His thigh a name written,
<span class="smcap">King of Kings, and Lord of Lords</span>.</p>

<p>"And I saw an angel standing in the
sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying
to all the birds that fly in mid heaven,
Come and be gathered together unto the great
supper of God; that ye may eat the flesh of
kings, and the flesh of captains, and the
flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses
and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh
of all men, both free and bond, and small
and great.</p>

<p>"And I saw the beast, and the kings of
the earth, and their armies, gathered together
to make war against Him that sat
upon the horse, and against His army.
And the beast was taken, and with him the
false prophet that wrought the signs in his
sight, wherewith he deceived them that had
received the mark of the beast, and them
that worshipped his image: they twain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
were cast alive into the lake of fire that
burneth with brimstone: and the rest were
killed with the sword of Him that sat upon
the horse, even the sword which came forth
out of His mouth: and all the birds were
filled with their flesh" (Rev. 19. 11-21).
Ezekiel similarly describes the scene in his
prophecy in chapter 30. 17-21.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the climax of the world's
rebellion against God is to meet its doom.
This is the manner of the overthrow of the
ten-kingdomed empire, the fourth of
Daniel's visions. Accordingly, what we
have now read from Revelation 19 is
identical with (1) the falling of the stone
upon the feet of the image in Nebuchadnezzar's
vision, the annihilation of all
Gentile government (Dan. 2. 45); (2) the
consuming of the dominion of the fourth
beast in Daniel's subsequent vision (Dan.
7. 26); (3) the pouring out of God's
wrath upon the Antichrist, the desolator
(Dan. 9. 27); and (4) the coming of the
Son of Man on the clouds of Heaven with
power and great glory (Matt. 24. 30).
The great emperor, the man of sin, is to
be crushed by the Lord Jesus, "with the
breath of His mouth," and brought to
nought "by the manifestation of His
coming" (2 Thess. 2. 8).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>Now this "manifestation of His coming"
is, to transliterate the Greek words,</p>


<h4>The Epiphany of His Parousia.</h4>

<p>An epiphany is, literally, the 'shining
forth' of that which has been hidden; and
the word Parousia is, literally, 'presence'
(see margin of <small>R.V.</small> and Phil. 2. 12).
This latter word is used of the coming of
Christ to the air for His saints, 'to receive
them unto Himself,' and of their consequent
presence with Him (1 Thess.
2. 19). They are thus to be "ever with the
Lord" (1 Thess. 4. 17), and with Him they
will come when He descends at His revelation
"from Heaven with the angels of His
power in flaming fire, rendering vengeance
to them that know not God, and to them
that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus"
(2 Thess. 1. 7, 8). The sudden bursting
forth of His glory thus "to execute judgment"
(Jude 15) will be the 'Epiphany,
or shining forth, of His Parousia,' and by
it the Man of Sin is to be brought to nought
and his empire demolished. He and his
false prophet will be "cast alive into the
lake of fire," and his armies will perish
(Rev. 19. 20, 21).</p>

<p>This is to be the issue of the world's
attempts to establish a millennium of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
own by schemes of federation and amalgamation.
This is the upshot of its fancied
progress and improvement without God
and His Christ.</p>

<p>We must now see what other Scriptures
have to say concerning this scene. The
instrument which the Lord uses for the
destruction of His foes is a sword which
proceeds <i>out of His mouth</i>; the destruction
is described as the treading of the
winepress.</p>


<h4>The Voice of the Lord.</h4>

<p>First, as to the instrument. The sword
is symbolic of the utterance of the Lord's
voice. No material instrument is needed,
a word is enough. This is clear from many
passages. In the second Psalm the overthrow
of the foe is thus described: "Then
shall He <i>speak</i> unto them in His wrath, and
vex them in His sore displeasure" (v. 5).
Joel prophesies of the same event: "The
sun and the moon are darkened, and the
stars withdraw their shining: and the
Lord <i>uttereth His voice</i> before His army;
for His camp is very great; for He is strong
that executeth His word: for the day of the
Lord is great and very terrible; and who
can abide it?" (Joel 2. 10, 11; and see
3. 16. With this compare Isa. 11. 4 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
30. 30-33.) The same voice of judgment is
implied in Paul's prediction of the doom
of the lawless one, that "the Lord Jesus
will slay him <i>with the breath of His
mouth</i>" (2 Thess. 2. 8). In the same connection
we are doubtless to read Psalm
29, the Psalm which describes the terrible
majesty and effect of the <i>voice of the Lord</i>.</p>

<p>We must presently dwell more fully
upon this Psalm in order to observe its
application to the circumstances under
consideration, and its connection with the
passages which describe the judgment of
the foe as</p>


<h4>The Treading of the Winepress.</h4>

<p>These passages are Isaiah 63. 1-6; Joel 9.
16; Revelation 14. 17-20, and the one
already quoted in Revelation 19. It is
observable, too, that in the first of these
the voice of the Lord is mentioned again,
for the Deliverer describes Himself as
"I that <i>speak in righteousness</i>."</p>

<p>We shall first refer to Revelation 14.
17-20. Two angels appear coming forth,
the one from the temple in Heaven with
a sickle in his hand, the other from the
altar. The latter calls to the one with the
sickle to gather "the clusters of the vine of
the earth," symbolic of the Man of Sin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
his gathered armies. The angel then casts
his sickle into the earth, gathers the vintage,
and casts it into the winepress of
the wrath of God. The winepress is
"trodden without the city," and "there
came out blood from the winepress, even
unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a
thousand and six hundred furlongs" (<i>i.e.</i>,
200 miles). The great emperor and his
prophet, and their vast forces, will thus
be gathered in dense battle array throughout
the length of Palestine, Jerusalem
being their objective. Joel calls the scene
of the battle "the Valley of Decision."
"Come, tread ye," says the prophet, "for
the winepress is full, the fats overflow; for
their wickedness is great. Multitudes,
multitudes in the valley of decision! for
the day of the Lord is near in the valley of
decision" (Joel 3. 13, 14). The multitudes
are the forces of the Man of Sin.</p>

<p>The first six verses of Isaiah 63 narrate
in the form of a dialogue</p>


<h4>The Overthrow of the Man of Sin</h4>

<p>and his forces. The dialogue is between
Messiah the Deliverer and the Jews.
Having just overthrown the foe in the
treading of the winepress, and the armies
of the Empire being destroyed throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the battle line from the north of
the land to the south, the Messiah, in
the fruits of His victory, reveals Himself
to His astonished earthly people.
In wondering admiration they exclaim:
"Who is this that cometh from Edom,
with dyed garments from Bozrah? this
that is glorious, marching in the greatness
of His strength?" To this their
Deliverer answers, "I that <i>speak in
righteousness</i>, mighty to save." The significance
of this is at once apparent to the
reader who calls to mind the various
passages mentioned above in reference to
the voice of the Lord. "I that speak in
righteousness"&mdash;this is the voice uttered
before His army (Joel 2. 10), "the sword
that proceedeth out of His mouth" (Rev.
19. 15); the "breath of His mouth," by
which the Man of Sin is crushed (2 Thess.
2. 8), and the "voice" of Psalm 29.</p>

<p>The people, struck by the appearance of
the Victor, next ask: "Wherefore art Thou
red in Thine apparel, and Thy garments
like him that treadeth in the winefat?"
The language is doubtless symbolic. Messiah
explains in reply how the threatening
foes have been crushed: "I have trodden the
winepress alone; and of the peoples there
was no man with Me: yea, I trod them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Mine anger, and trampled them in My
fury; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon
My garments, and I have stained all My
raiment. For the day of vengeance was
in Mine heart, and the year of My redeemed
is come. And I looked, and there
was none to help; and I wondered that there
was none to uphold: therefore Mine own
arm brought salvation unto Me; and My
fury, it upheld Me. And I trod down the
peoples in Mine anger, and made them
drunk in My fury, and I poured out their
lifeblood on the earth" (vv. 3-6). The
words of a previous prophecy express the
joyful recognition of the delivered nation:
"And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this
is our God; we have waited for Him, and
He will save us: this is the Lord; we have
waited for Him, we will be glad and
rejoice in His salvation" (Isa. 25. 9).</p>

<p>Turning now to Psalm 29 we find</p>


<h4>The Scene of Judgment</h4>

<p>strikingly depicted; the very length of the
battle line is indicated, in agreement with
the later and clearer description in Revelation
20. 14. Indeed, the passages which
foretell the events of this coming terrible
day afford a remarkable illustration of the
progressive character of the revelations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Scripture. The Psalm is divided into three
parts: (1) The first three verses are a call
to the saints in Heaven, the "sons of the
mighty," to worship the Lord in view of
the judgment He is just about to execute
for the deliverance of His people the Jews,
their land and their city. (2) The second
part, verses 3-9, describes the actual
judgment by means of "the voice of the
Lord." The psalmist was doubtless thinking
of a thunderstorm. The Spirit of God
was giving prophetic utterance concerning
a more terrible scene, and the geographical
limitations of the Psalm are of prophetic
import. The first place mentioned is
Lebanon, in the north, with its mountain-spur
Sirion (vv. 5, 6). The last place is
the wilderness of Kadesh, in the south, the
centre of which is Bozrah, in Edom (v. 8),
a point of connection with Isaiah 63. 1.
Now the distance from Sirion to Bozrah,
in the wilderness of Kadesh, is 200 miles,
and this is the 1600 furlongs of Revelation
14.20. Here, then, in one fell stroke
of divine wrath the Man of Sin and his
forces are overthrown, and the Jews are
delivered. The later revelations of Scripture
thus enable us to pass from the natural
and physical setting of the Psalm to the
veiled reality. Thus this portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Psalm is to be read in connection with the
passage from Revelation 19 quoted above.
(3) The last two verses describe the results
of the conquest.</p>


<h4>The Jews in their Extremity</h4>

<p>were threatened with annihilation. But
man's extremity is God's opportunity.
The people now see their Deliverer in
person, they "look on Him whom they
pierced." They realise that their enemies
were destroyed because "the Lord sat as
King at the flood." And now "the Lord
sitteth as King for ever." He whose right
it is to reign has come to Zion. Hence the
psalmist can next say: "The Lord will
give strength unto His people; the Lord
will bless His people with peace." Armageddon
is over, the winepress of God's
wrath has been trodden, and the war
against the Lamb is ended. Psalm 30
follows on with the people's song of praise
for deliverance.</p>

<p>The judgments of God in the earth
will be accompanied by</p>


<h4>Seismic Disturbances,</h4>

<p>including "a great earthquake such as was
not since there were men upon the earth,"
the overthrow of the cities of the nations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and the displacement of islands and mountains
(Rev. 16. 18-21). Then doubtless
will be fulfilled the prophecy of Zechariah,
that in the day when the Lord goes forth
to fight against the nations that are
gathered against Jerusalem, His feet will
stand upon the Mount of Olives, and
the mountain will be divided, leaving a
very great valley east of the city (Zech.
14. 1-5).</p>


<h4>The Everlasting Kingdom.</h4>

<p>In this tremendous intervention in the
affairs of the world for the termination of
Gentile dominion the Son of God will be
accompanied by all His saints. He will
come "to be glorified in His saints, and to
be marvelled at in all them that believed"
(2 Thess. 1. 10). So from earliest times
Enoch had prophesied: "Behold, the
Lord came with His holy myriads, to
execute judgment upon all" (Jude 14,
15, margin). And Zechariah: "The Lord
my God shall come, and all the saints with
Thee" (14. 5). They are to take an active
part in the inauguration of His Kingdom,
and in its government. For "the saints
of the Most High shall receive the Kingdom,
and possess the Kingdom for ever,
even for ever and ever" (Dan. 7. 18). "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness
of the Kingdoms under the whole
Heaven, shall be given to the people of the
saints of the Most High" (v. 27).</p>

<p>Then shall the Lord "be King over all
the earth" (Zech. 14. 9). God's claims
will be vindicated. His Christ will reign
as King of Righteousness, and King of
Peace, the centre of His government being
the very place where once He was despised
and rejected, and men cast Him out and
crucified Him. Of the increase of His
government and of peace there shall be no
end, upon the throne of David, and upon
His Kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold
it with judgment and with righteousness
from henceforth even for ever. The
zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this
(Isa. 9. 7). His saints "shall be priests
of God and of Christ, and shall reign with
Him a thousand years" (Rev. 20. 6).
Then will be fulfilled the words of the
Lord, "I am returned unto Zion, and will
dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and
Jerusalem shall be called the city of truth;
and the mountain of the Lord of hosts the
holy mountain" (Zech. 8. 3). The days
of Israel's mourning will be ended, the
nation will be a "crown of beauty in
the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in the hand of her God," and Jerusalem
will be a praise in the earth (Isa. 60. 30;
62. 3, 7). "The Heavens shall rejoice
and the earth be glad," and "the earth
shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,
as the waters cover the sea" (Psa. 96. 11;
Isa. 11. 9). According to God's Eternal
Counsel the despised Nazarene will yet be
manifested and acknowledged by all as
King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
